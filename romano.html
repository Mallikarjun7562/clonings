      <h2>JAMIE FLOYD: UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an
        eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone.
        It is CRAZY. But <br />
        we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it
        done! The place is beautiful!"

      <h2>DONNA AND SCOTT: RESCUED RENOVATION</h2>
      <br />
      "Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great,
      neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we
      know <br />
      it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"
      <br /><br />
      <h2>DAVID SIEGEL: DOUBLED THE VALUE</h2>
      <br />
      "Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a
      pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut <br>
      renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home
      improvements."
